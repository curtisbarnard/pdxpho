    "notes": "The basil is crisp and unbruised, and the bean sprouts are full and intact. Lime and jalapeño are fresh. The broth has a clove and anise aroma with a noticeable sweetness. The flavor is very sweet and salty but backed by solid beefiness. The noodles have a good bite but tend to clump. The meatball is very soft with a strong white pepper flavor. The *tai* has good texture but doesn’t taste particularly fresh. The brisket is flavorful and well-cooked, while the flank is a bit dry. The tripe has a pleasant beefiness, and the tendon is soft and well-cooked. Price is $17.50, but they have a CC processing fee.",

    "notes": "This is not phở bò. The aroma is heavy on garlic and shrimp, and the flavor leans more porky than beefy with a strong sweetness and lots of garlic. I had to ask for herbs. The bean sprouts are full and white, though some pieces are brown. The basil is slightly limp and bruised. The noodles lack bite but don’t clump or break apart. The meatballs are sweet, bouncy, and heavily emulsified with little tendon. Another cut, possibly round, is thick but tender and not too dry. This isn’t Vietnamese phở bò, and the rating reflects that, but the broth is good, and I’d order it again.",

    "notes": "The basil is bruised, but the bean sprouts are full and white. It looks like they use serrano peppers instead of jalapeño. The broth's aroma is heavy on cinnamon and clove with a sour, lime-like note but not much beefiness. The flavor is light, sweet, and salty, lacking real depth, with cinnamon and clove dominating. The noodles are well-cooked with a good bite, no clumping or breaking. The tai is decent, but the flank is tough, dry, and mealy. The tripe is okay, though slightly funky. The meatballs are underwhelming, tasting like they have too much starchy filler.",

The broth's aroma is thin, with a stale ground spice scent of clove, anise, and cinnamon. The flavor is shallow, not very beefy, and more savory than sweet, with muted spices. The noodles are overcooked but not clumping or falling apart. The tai is a bit tough but has a clean taste. The flank is dry and grainy. The meatballs are decent with a noticeable black pepper flavor. The tendon is too hard, undercooked for my liking, but the tripe is well-cooked and clean tasting.",

The broth has a beefy aroma with a hint of clove and cinnamon, though it’s not very aromatic overall, and the beefiness has a slight funk. The flavor is very sweet with good beefiness, and clove and cinnamon dominate. The noodles are cooked well with a good bite but clump a little. All the meats have good flavor. The tai is slightly chewy, and the flank is dry and turning grainy. The meatballs have good tendon, a little sweetness, and solid beefiness. This is a to-go order, with the noodles, broth, and onions packed separately to be combined at home.",

The steak is thick-cut, slightly chewy, and has an irony flavor but isn’t very beefy. The noodles also have a strong anise taste.",

The aroma is strong on anise and clove, with onion notes and a nice underlying beefiness. The flavor is rich with fatty beefiness and green onion, slightly too sweet but not overly so. The noodles are clumping, starting to fall apart, and have a rubbery texture. The meatballs are beefy with a nice pepper note, and I prefer the slicing over quartering or halving. The sirloin is bland and grainy. The shop’s special is pho Annam with sliced sautéed beef, but I ordered pho bac, which is closer to a standard dac biet and used that for the rating.",
